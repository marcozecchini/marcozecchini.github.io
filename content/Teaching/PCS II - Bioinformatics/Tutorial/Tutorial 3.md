In this tutorial we will see how Git and Github works and we will do some exercises on Sorting from Rosalind.
# Git and Github

What are Git and Github? Let us see this [slides](https://sclipman.com/talk/github-talk/GitHubPresentation.pdf).

Let us do the following steps, now:
1. Register in [Github](https://github.com/)
2. Install Git on your computer downloading it from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
3. [Set up Git in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/intro-to-git#_set-up-git-in-vs-code)
4. Create a new folder in your computer, wherever you prefer
5. Open the folder in Visual Studio
6. Create a new file called: `README.md`
7. Fill the file  `README.md` with the following content:
```markdown
# Welcome

This is my first commit.
```
8.  [Publish local repository to Github](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/intro-to-git#_publish-local-repository-to-github)
	1. If you accidentally pushed `Initialize`, execute this [step](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/intro-to-git#_staging-and-committing-code-changes) to commit the changes...
	2. ...and, then, this [step](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/intro-to-git#_pushing-and-pulling-remote-changes) to publish the commit to the remote repository
9. Edit the `README.md` file with:
```markdown
# Welcome

This is my second commit.
```
10. [Stage and Commit code changes](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/intro-to-git#_staging-and-committing-code-changes)
11. Sync with the remote repository by following [this command](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/intro-to-git#_pushing-and-pulling-remote-changes)
